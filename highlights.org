- We measure the \ce{CO2} absorption capacity of amino acid salts in a microfluidic device.

- \ce{CO2} loading of absorbent solutions can be measured with <1 mL of sample in <1 hour.

- \ce{CO2} loadings measured with microfluidic device are compared with CSTR measurements.

- Salt of lysine absorbed >90% more \ce{CO2} on a per mole of amine/amino acid basis than MEA.

- Raman spectroscopy was used to determine reaction products for each amino acid salt.
