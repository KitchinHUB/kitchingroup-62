  abstract =	 {Amine scrubbing has been used to separate carbon
                  dioxide (CO2) from natural gas and hydrogen since
                  1930. It is a robust technology and is ready to be
                  tested and used on a larger scale for CO2 capture
                  from coal-fired power plants. The minimum work
                  requirement to separate CO2 from coal-fired flue gas
                  and compress CO2 to 150 bar is 0.11 megawatt-hours
                  per metric ton of CO2. Process and solvent
                  improvements should reduce the energy consumption to
                  0.2 megawatt-hour per ton of CO2. Other advanced
                  technologies will not provide energy-efficient or
                  timely solutions to CO2 emission from conventional
                  coal-fired power plants.},

                  pilot plant with 3.5 M potassium sarcosine are
                  presented. Both absorption kinetics and energy
                  consumption are studied. The results show clearly
                  that the amino acid salt system has a high
                  absorption rate and high energy requirement compared
                  to 30wt-% MEA. The solvent system has been modeled
                  in an in-house tool and simulation results are
                  compared with the some performance results obtained
                  experimentally. The soft-model approach developed
                  for the potassium sarcosine solvent systems
                  represents the absorber fairly well, while it seems
                  to be too simplified to represent the stripper

  abstract =	 "We present an automated microfluidic (MF) approach
                  for the systematic and rapid investigation of carbon
                  dioxide (CO2) mass transfer and solubility in
                  physical solvents. Uniformly sized bubbles of CO2
                  with lengths exceeding the width of the microchannel
                  (plugs) were isothermally generated in a co-flowing
                  physical solvent within a gas-impermeable{,}
                  silicon-based MF platform that is compatible with a
                  wide range of solvents{,} temperatures and
                  pressures. We dynamically determined the volume
                  reduction of the plugs from images that were
                  accommodated within a single field of view{,} six
                  different downstream locations of the microchannel
                  at any given flow condition. Evaluating plug sizes
                  in real time allowed our automated strategy to
                  suitably select inlet pressures and solvent flow
                  rates such that otherwise dynamically self-selecting
                  parameters (e.g.{,} the plug size{,} the solvent
                  segment size{,} and the plug velocity) could be
                  either kept constant or systematically
                  altered. Specifically{,} if a constant slug length
                  was imposed{,} the volumetric dissolution rate of
                  CO2 could be deduced from the measured rate of plug
                  shrinkage. The solubility of CO2 in the physical
                  solvent was obtained from a comparison between the
                  terminal and the initial plug sizes. Solubility data
                  were acquired every 5 min and were within 2-5%
                  accuracy as compared to literature data. A parameter
                  space consisting of the plug length{,} solvent slug
                  length and plug velocity at the microchannel inlet
                  was established for different CO2-solvent pairs with
                  high and low gas solubilities. In a case study{,} we
                  selected the gas-liquid pair CO2-dimethyl carbonate
                  (DMC) and volumetric mass transfer coefficients 4-30
                  s-1 (translating into mass transfer times between
                  0.25 s and 0.03 s){,} and Henry{'}s constants{,}
                  within the range of 6-12 MPa.",

                  devices. Elongated bubbles are individually produced
                  using a hydrodynamic focusing section into a compact
                  microchannel. The initial bubble size is determined
                  based on the fluid volumetric flow rates of
                  injection and the channel geometry. By contrast{,}
                  the bubble dissolution rate is found to depend on
                  the inlet gas pressure and the fluid pair
                  composition. For short periods of time after the
                  fluids initial contact{,} the bubble length
                  decreases linearly with time. We show that the
                  initial rate of bubble shrinkage is proportional to
                  the ratio of the diffusion coefficient and the
                  Henry{'}s law constant associated with each fluid
                  pair. Our study shows the possibility to rapidly
